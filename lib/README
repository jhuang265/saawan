This libharu library is included with the project source because it's a special
build of libharu. It's actually built from this PR: 
https://github.com/libharu/libharu/pull/142 which seems to add support for
OpenType fonts. Until this is merged into the main repository, this compiler
should be linked with this build of the library.
